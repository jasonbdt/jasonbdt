# Hi there, I'm Jason 👋

**Software Developer | Python & AI Engineering | Fullstack Development | Continuous Learner**  
💼 *Open to Work – looking for opportunities in Python/AI Engineering and Fullstack Development*

---

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a software developer who combines professional experience in fullstack
development with a strong focus on Python and AI engineering. I enjoy
transforming ideas into working solutions, mentoring others (and having fun
while doing so), and exploring how technology can solve real-world problems.

Outside of coding, I constantly look for ways to improve myself – whether
through structured learning, creative side projects, or experimenting with
new technologies.

## 🚀 Current Focus
- Python & AI Engineering (data pipelines, algorithms, applied ML)  
- Clean code, testing, documentation standards (PEP-8/PEP-257)  
- Fullstack development with Angular, NestJS, Docker, MongoDB  
- Hardware/software tinkering (ESP32, Raspberry Pi, automation)
